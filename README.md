- `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL for the frontend application.

#### Frontend Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_SERVER`: The backend server URL, which should be `http://localhost:5000` for local development.

### Running the Project

1. **Start the backend server**

```bash
cd backend
npm start
